# Galaxy Electron

## Description

This is a project to study the use of [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) and [THREE.js](https://threejs.org).

## Running

Install all the deps

- `yarn`

Since this is only in the begining and I'm learning how to use Webpack too, you will need to build first to run propertly.

- `yarn build`

After the `dist` folder has been created, you can start the electron app

- `yarn start`
